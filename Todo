TODO list for Perl module Net::BitTorrent

High priorities:
- Documentation
  + Incomplete/missing
    - Net::BitTorrent
      - callbacks are still undocumented
- Complete callback system
- Endgame (untested)
- Trackers need the correct event param

Short term goals:
- The return of Fast Extension aka 'Fast Peers'
- Bugs
  + Cannot remove torrents that have open handles (I'm lazy)
- Improve handling of slow pieces
- client.pl?
  + -skip_hashcheck should try to load the bitfield from disk?
  + occasional storage of the bitfield to disk on hash_pass?
- finish test suite
- limit number of unchoked peers

Long term goals:
- Internal bans for 'bad' peers
  + Penalty (and eventual ban) for peers who always seem involved
    with bad pieces
- taint safe
- Disconnect when both are seeds
- IP-filter based bans
- improve file handling
  + .piece file to store incoming blocks
- Limits for transfer bandwidth
- UDP trackers
- Extensions
  + DHT/PEX
  + Wire protocol encryption?
  + Extension protocol?
  + Extension Negotiation Protocol?
  + BitComet Extension Protocol?
- N::B::Lite - barebones client?
  + Single class
  + No extentions
  + Trimmed API
- gui-client.pl?
  + very light gui example using perl/TK
- perlcritic severity=stern?
- non-blocking hash_check()
