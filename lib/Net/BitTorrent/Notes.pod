=head1 Quests and Callbacks

Net::BitTorrent's new callback system differs greatly from the previous
version. When a callback is set, the return value is an arrayref containing
the basic information to keep the callback relevent. The only strong reference
to this 'quest' or 'callback' is the value returned so, for example, to stop
searching for peers, simply destroy this quest in your code (end the scope,
setting the variable used to store it to C<undef>, etc.).
