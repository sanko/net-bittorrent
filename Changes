Version 0.015 | 2008-04-11 20:00:26 -0400 (Fri, 11 Apr 2008)

 Notes:
  - Dup of 0.013 to fix bad M::B dist.  Something fishy going on with
    the gzip'd file.  Some systems (like PAUSE) properly extract
    directories and some (like the cpan shell) extract it all into the
    base directory causing build failures.
